Step-By-Step: Building an Opencast Matterhorn RPM repository on CentOS 6
==============================================================================

Notice: For more Information about RPM creation have a look at the excellent
        howto in the Fedora Wiki located at:
        http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/How_to_create_an_RPM_package

For this walkthrough a fresh installed CentOS 6.2.x86_64 system was used after
installing the OS the only thing I did was to install the latest updates by
running »yum update«.

Step 1: System Preparation
--------------------------

# Install needed packages for RPM development:
yum groupinstall Base 'Development Tools'
yum install rpmdevtools.noarch rpmlint.noarch createrepo.noarch

# Create new user for RPM development. It's best to have a separate user for
# this. At least you should never create RPMs as root as one little mistake in
# the SPEC files which would simple give you an error as non privileged user
# could break your whole system as root.
/usr/sbin/useradd makerpm
passwd makerpm
su makerpm

# Create the ~/rpmbuild directory and a set of subdirectories, which you will
# use for creating the packages.
cd
rpmdev-setuptree


Step 2: Install build dependencies
----------------------------------

# Enable EPEL and Rpmforge repositories.
yum localinstall --nogpgcheck \
  http://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/6/i386/epel-release-6-5.noarch.rpm

#Enable optional Red Hat channels in Satellite or Red Hat Network

# Install build dependencies.
yum install dos2unix libzen0-devel zlib-devel libcurl-devel libtiff-devel \
    nasm yasm ImageMagick SDL-devel librsvg2-devel libGLU-devel \
    freeglut-devel freetype-devel libjpeg-devel libpng-devel \
    js-devel libxml2-devel openssl-devel pulseaudio-libs-devel libogg-devel \
    libvorbis-devel libtheora-devel libXt-devel libXpm-devel libXv-devel \
    wxGTK-devel gtk+-devel gtk2-devel php-cli id3lib-devel libsysfs-devel \
    fftw-devel opencv-devel bzip2-devel dirac-devel gsm-devel \
    imlib2-devel lame-devel libdc1394-devel libraw1394-devel libva-devel \
    libvdpau-devel openjpeg-devel schroedinger-devel speex-devel \
    vo-aacenc-devel




There may be some additional dependencies I have missed. If that is the case
the rpmbuild tool while tell you exactly what is missing when you try to build
a package so you can install it and give me a hint that something is missing in
this howto.


Step 3: Install source RPMs
-------------------------------------------------

The next step is to download all necessary source RPMs. You can do this
manually or even install them via rpm over http, however I suggest using curl
to download them all at once:

cd ~/rpmbuild/SRPMS/
rm -rf *.src.rpm
curl 'http://lernfunk.de/matterhorn-repo/SRPMS/release/CentOS/6/filelist.py' | \
  xargs -n1 -i curl -O "http://lernfunk.de/matterhorn-repo/SRPMS/release/CentOS/6/{}"
rpm -ivh *.src.rpm

Now all necessary spec files should be in ~/rpmbuild/SPECS and source files in
~/rpmbuild/SOURCES. In other words: We are ready for the build process.


Step 4: Build binary RPMs
-------------------------------------------------

Now we have to build the RPMs one after another. Obviously we have to start
with those which do not depend on ones we still have to build. After we build a
package we have to check if another package we want to build depends on it. If
that is the case we have to install the new package. Then we can move to the
next package.

Following you will find a list of commands you have to execute. We use
»rpmbuild -ba SPECFILE« to build a package. The ready to use RPM file will go
into ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/ARCH/. At the end we install the new package using »yum
localinstall URI« and »su -c CMD« as we need root privileges to install RPMs
into the system.

# Switch to SPEC folder.
cd rpmbuild/SPECS

su -c 'yum localinstall --nogpgcheck \

rpmbuild -ba ffmpeg.spec


# Build matterhorn and direct dependencies
rpmbuild -ba maven.spec
su -c 'yum install --nogpgcheck ../RPMS/x86_64/maven-3*.rpm'
rpmbuild -ba opencast-matterhorn13.spec


Step 4: Create repository for RPM files
---------------------------------------

The next step is to create a repository for all created RPMs. It should be
available from all systems you want to use it for. Common ways to do this are
to put the repository on a FTP or HTTP server or do a SSH mount. Of cause you
can place the repo in a local file system, too. But the other ways are easier to
maintain when it comes to updates, etc.

Commands (You may ommit everything related to the SRPMS):
mkdir -p ~/matterhorn-repo/CentOS/6/{noarch,SRPMS,x86_64}
cp -r ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/* ~/matterhorn_repo/CentOS/6/x86_64 
cp -r ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/noarch/* ~/matterhorn_repo/CentOS/6/noarch 
cp -r ~/rpmbuild/SRPMS/*       ~/matterhorn_repo/CentOS/6/SRPMS
createrepo ~/matterhorn_repo/CentOS/6/x86_64
createrepo ~/matterhorn_repo/CentOS/6/noarch

That is it. Your repo in now finished. Put it somewhere reachable. For example
you can use the Apache http daemon to distribute it via the HTTP protocol.
cp -r ~/matterhorn-repo /var/www/html/


Step 5: Enable repository
-------------------------
Lets assume your repo is now reachable via http://example.com/matterhorn-repo.
Create the file /etc/yum.repos.d/matterhorn.repo using your favorite editor and
enter:


[matterhorn]
name = Matterhorn CentOS $releasever Repository
baseurl  = http://example.com/matterhorn_repo/CentOS/$releasever/$basearch
enabled  = 1
protect  = 0
gpgcheck = 0

[matterhorn-noarch]
name = Matterhorn CentOS $releasever Repository noarch
baseurl  = http://example.com/matterhorn_repo/CentOS/$releasever/noarch
enabled  = 1
protect  = 0
gpgcheck = 0


Now your repository is enabled for use with yum (and other rpm based update
managers). You can now simply copy this file to any computer you want to use
the repository on.
